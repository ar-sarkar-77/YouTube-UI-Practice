# YouTube-UI-Practice
A practice design for a YouTube app interface. The design includes elements like "Shorts," video titles (e.g., "Nature Trouvaille," "ISRAEL," "HOW TO BE A LIFE"), and a sidebar with options such as "Home," "Subscriptions," and "You." This is a conceptual or mockup design for learning purposes.
